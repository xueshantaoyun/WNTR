.. [*] Cross reference labels begins with 4 letters:

   * If the citation has one author, the first 4 letters of name are used
   * If the citation has two authors, the first 2 letters of author 1 and first 2 letters of author 2 are used
   * If the citation has three authors, the first 2 letters of author 1, first letter of author 2, and first letter of author 3 are used
   * If the citation has four authors, the first letter of each author is used

   * Exceptions are made for American Lifelines Alliance (ALA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
	
   The next two digits are the year (century ignored).
   If the 6 digits match another citation, a lower case letter (a, b, ...) is added.
   Cross reference notation will be updated to a standard format when better options come available.
